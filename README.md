The Thermodynamic Equation of Seawater
This study explores complex dynamics of salinity, temperature, and dissolved oxygen concentrations across distinct water masses in the Gulf of Guinea using the GLODAPv2.2022_Atlantic_ocean data. Temperature concentrations are observed between 3 to 3.8 degrees of latitude, spanning from north to south. At specific latitudes, namely 3, 3.4, and 5 degrees, temperature peaks at 28 degrees Celsius are observed. Additionally, the salinity value ranges from 32.0 to 36.0. Salinity concentration peaks between 3- and 4-degrees latitude, with the highest value observed around 3.4 degrees latitude. Furthermore, dissolved oxygen concentrations span from 6.0 to 10.0 mg/L. A concentration of dissolved oxygen is observed between 3.0 to 3.6 degrees of latitude, where the peak value is recorded at 3.0 degrees latitude. However, between 3.6 to 5.0 degrees latitude, no data is available to capture the dissolved oxygen trend. Distinct water masses in the region, such as Guinea Current Water (GCW), exhibit warm temperatures, high oxygen levels, and moderate salinity. The Coastal Upwelling Zones (CUZ) display high oxygen levels, variable temperatures due to upwelling, and moderately higher saline conditions. The Equatorial Undercurrent Water (EUW) is characterized by cooler temperatures, high oxygen levels, and moderate salinity, indicating favorable conditions for marine life. Similarly, the Subtropical Underwater (STUW) features cooler temperatures, high oxygen levels, and moderate salinity, supporting diverse marine habitats and ecosystem health. The Deep Water (DW) in the Gulf of Guinea showcases high dissolved oxygen levels (>9.7-10.2 mg/L), cooler temperatures (~5Â°C below the surface), and moderate salinity (34.61-35.4 g/kg), nurturing marine life and ensuring stability. All these contribute to the marine ecosystems, biodiversity, and environmental stability in the region.
